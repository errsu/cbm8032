Setting up serial UART in Raspi

Info from:
https://raspberry-projects.com/programming-in-c/uart-serial-port/using-the-uart

To disable serial as terminal input, in file /root/cmdline.txt,
remove "console=serial0,115200" from the commandline.

Before the line read:
dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=serial0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p7 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles

It is not clear, though, if this is still needed.

In RaspiMenu->Einstellungen->Raspberry-Pi-Konfiguration
in Tab Schnittstellen -> Serial Port click Aktiviert and Ok (reboot).

This creates /dev/serial0.

But, it can only handle 1MBit/s

According to https://www.circuits.dk/setup-raspberry-pi-3-gpio-uart/
swapped uarts, and use /dev/serial0 in the code, same pins (RX = pin10).
To do this, sudo open the file /boot/config.txt.
It already has as last line:
enable_uart=1

Add another line:
dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt

This seems to enable 2MBit/s easily.
